Get ready to explore the whole range of emotions through a masculine lens in this feel-good comedy.</p><p>Seven men, aged from 17 to 70 years old, all city-dwellers, meet up at a remote railway station for an unusual boot camp that they hope will get them back on their feet. They have nothing in common except that they are all on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Each step in this boot camp, devised by eccentric and feisty female coach, Omega (Marina Hands), aims to reveal their true selves.  The task is a tough one, especially as nothing goes as planned. </p><p>Director Audrey Dana (<em>French Women</em> and <em>If I Were a Boy</em>) takes us on a comedic journey. <em>Men on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown</em> explores cultural norms and gender stereotypes with stunning performances from Thierry Lhermitte and Ramzy Bedia. With fun and good humour Dana invites all men to get in touch with their more feminine side and in turn learn how to become a better man.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
