The body of a beautiful young woman is discovered at Place Vintimille, dressed in an elegant evening gown. There is nothing to identify her, and no witnesses. Pensive and world-weary inspector Jules Maigret (Depardieu) endeavours to piece together her story, and in doing so uncovers details about her past and character. In his enquiries, he encounters Betty (Jade Labeste), a woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to the victim, but who also reminds him of one even closer to his own life…</p><p>Simenon (and Leconte’s) formidable protagonist - a French counterpart to Agatha Christie’s <em>Poirot</em> and P.D. James’ <em>Dalgliesh</em> - has been brought to the screen before, but Depardieu leaves an indelible stamp on the character, bringing tenderness and dignity to a man prepared to listen before he speaks, and to stand up for those without a voice. It’s an absolute pleasure to join him, as Maigret irascibly and ingeniously follows the clues.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
