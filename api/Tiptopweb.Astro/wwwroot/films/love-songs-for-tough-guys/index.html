But Jeff is distracted: he’s fallen for Roxane, a supermarket cashier he adores from afar. Taking a leaf from the <em>Cyrano</em> playbook, he tries to win her heart by writing love poems, but doesn’t have the courage to deliver them. Meanwhile, Jeff’s grizzled and near-mute enforcer is sent to shake down local suburban widow Suzanne (a never-better Paradis), who is preparing to portray Simone de Beauvoir in the community theatre’s annual musical, but instead finds himself drawn into the actual production…</p><p>Featuring an exquisitely layered script that slowly reveals genuine pathos for all its characters, <em>Love Songs for Tough Guys</em> is a deadpan but giddily romantic fable of imperfect people with complex and passionate interior lives. Huge-hearted and funny, it’s one of the most entertaining and intelligent comedies of this year’s selection.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
