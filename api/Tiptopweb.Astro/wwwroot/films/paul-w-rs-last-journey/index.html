Suddenly the red moon changes its course and threatens the earth’s existence. The only hope of saving earth and humanity is the enigmatic Paul W.R., the most talented astronaut of his generation. But a few hours before the start of the Great Mission, Paul disappears…</p><p>This high-concept jaunt through the galaxy features the best of what French cinema has to offer, acting that would feel at home in our everyday lives but coupled with direction that will inspire audiences with ambitious and beautifully-crafted worlds. <em>Paul W.R.’s Last Journey</em> is an ode to the fun of the 80s that feels fresh and original to the sci-fi genre. It’s excitement that’s not to be missed. </p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
