The suffering of a mother (Catherine Deneuve, <em>Happy Birthday</em>, AF FFF20; <em>Claire Darling</em>, AF FFF19) facing the unbearable. The dedication of a doctor (Dr. Gabriel Sara) and a nurse (Cécile de France, also starring in this year’s <em>Lost Illusions</em>) to accompany them on the impossible path to acceptance.</p><p>Writer and director Emmanuelle Bercot initially set out to explore the undying connection between a mother and her child, but through a chance encounter with Dr. Gabriel Sara, a dedicated cancer specialist who plays himself, the story of <em>Peaceful</em> unfolds like the stages of grief itself. Bercot chose to combine the realistic with the philosophical in this devastatingly beautiful tragedy, that leans on Sara’s real-life experiences and Magimel’s transformative performance, to convey the slow and poignant loosening of the mortal coil.</p><p><em>Peaceful</em> is a touching story of the process of engaging in a ‘dance’ with the disease, trying to tame it, and coming to understand what it means to be dying while still living. A deeply moving film that examines the vulnerability of humanity and will leave audiences thinking ‘what would I do in that situation?’</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
