Both are drawn to each other and begin a passionate affair. While Pierre’s family life is soon turned upside down - his wife (de France) incredulous at the age difference - Shauna struggles with feelings she thought well-belonged to the past, and the promise of what may remain…</p><p>Inspired by real events experienced by the mother of one of Tardieu’s closest friends, the late Sólveig Anspach, this wonderful new film deftly avoids sentimentality, and empathises as equally with those affected by the couple’s unexpected connection as it does with them. Capturing the thrill, guilt and vulnerability of December-May romances, <em>The Young Lovers</em> is a hugely moving call to arms to fully appreciate life, no matter society’s preconceptions.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
