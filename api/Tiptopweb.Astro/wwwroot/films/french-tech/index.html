Director Bruno Podalydès (<em>The Sweet Escape</em>, AF FFF16) highlights the joyful absurdity of juggling the work-life balance.</p><p>Alexandre (Denis Podalydès, <em>Anaïs in Love</em>, AF FFF22), unemployed and out of touch, has two months to prove to his wife that he can look after his two young children and be financially independent. Problem: The Box, a very “friendly” start-up that wants to hire him on a trial basis but has a strict policy: No children!   </p><p>Séverine (Sandrine Kiberlain, who also stars in this year’s Festival <em>Hear Me Out</em>), his future boss, is erratic and highly-strung, just waiting for Alexandre to make a mistake. Things begin to fall into place when he meets Arcimboldo (Bruno Podalydès), juggling jobs in the gig economy, who offers to look after Alexandre’s kids in exchange for accommodation. But between Severine’s incessant conference calls and endless team-building sessions, can Alexandre keep his secret?</p><p>Together this unlikely trio of characters share a relatable snapshot of working in your fifties. <em>French Tech</em> gives us all permission to laugh during that awkward office zoom call. </p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
