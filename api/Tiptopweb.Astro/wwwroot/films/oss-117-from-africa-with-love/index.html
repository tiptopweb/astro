Feminism is gaining ground; computer technology is developing and Communists lurk everywhere.  In the midst of all this, France sends its top spy to Africa to help out President Bamba, whose re-election is threatened by rebels, led covertly by his young wife, played by the gorgeous Fatou N’Diaye. </p><p>This mission is trickier, more treacherous, and more torrid than ever and OSS 117 must, for the first time, team up with a young rival with considerable assets: the up-and-coming OSS 1001  (Pierre Niney, <em>Goliath</em>, AF FFF22). Starring Oscar winner, Jean Dujardin (<em>I Feel Good</em>, AF FFF19; <em>Deerskin</em>, AF FFF20), <em>OSS 117: From Africa With Love</em> is a delightful and entertaining movie with a healthy dose of satire.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
