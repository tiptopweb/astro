Things do not go to plan. Facing serious financial difficulties, she reluctantly accepts a job in the cafeteria of a shelter for young migrants. Though she hates the new job at first, Cathy’s remarkable skill and passion for cuisine start to change the kids’ lives.  And it turns out they also have a lot to teach her.</p><p>True to his favourite genre, social comedy, Louis-Julien Petit explores learning, communication, success and self-esteem, mixing humour, humanism, realism and entertainment. With <em>The Kitchen Brigade</em>, the director pays tribute to young people with a tormented past and an uncertain future, holding onto hope of a better life, struggling relentlessly to integrate into French society; and of course, acknowledges  all those who devote so much energy to help them.</p><p>This feel-good movie with a strong touch of humanity also features François Cluzet (<em>Intouchables</em> and <em>We’ll End Up Together</em>, AF FFF20) and several newcomers, including Fatoumata Kaba.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
