Between his work in the community and rising tensions at home, Nour dreams of escaping to a faraway place. When he crosses paths with Sarah (Judith Chemla, <em>A Woman’s Life</em>, AF FFF17), an opera singer teaching summer classes,  he finally finds the opportunity to come out of his shell and explore new horizons.</p><p>Avoiding clichés, the filmmaker – with the help of cinematographer Marco Graziaplena – captures the siblings through a lens influenced by Italian cinema of the 1960s and 70s and adeptly presents an inspiring slice-of-life film filled with tender,  touching moments.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
