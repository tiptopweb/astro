Sick and half-paralysed in his hospital bed, he asks Emmanuelle to help him end his life. But can you honour such a request from your own father?</p><p>What follows is a deeply human take on a difficult subject. Despite what is still a taboo topic in France, this film treads lightly, offering poignant light-hearted scenes that will make you laugh but also bring tears to your eyes.</p><p>This bittersweet, witty drama cleverly reveals the complexities of family dynamics. Premiered at the Cannes Film Festival 2021, <em>Everything Went Fine</em> is one of François Ozon’s most beautifully crafted films to date. Sophie Marceau has never been better alongside a simply masterful André Dussollier.</p></div><p class="py-4"><a class="underline text-orange-600 hover:text-orange-800" href="/">back to list of films</a></p>
