The one big difference? One lives in 2020 and the other in 1942 during WWII. A magical chest, hidden in an attic transports them through time to live each other’s lives. Margot and Marguerite find themselves on a wild adventure, searching for their fathers while grappling with the complexities of the time they are sent to. Despite the 77-year gap between the two girls, they quickly realise they have a lot in common. They both need to find a way to deal with their overbearing families and learn to accept who they are.  </p><p>Adapted from the children’s comic book <em>Le Temps des Marguerite</em>, <em>The Fantastic Journey of Margot &amp; Marguerite</em> is a time travel adventure with surprises! A funny and spirited tale  of two girls learning about trust, love, courage and their place  in the world. </p><p></p>
