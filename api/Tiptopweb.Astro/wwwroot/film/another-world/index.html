		</p><p class="astro-6DCGTPXF"></p><p>The remarkable Vincent Lindon (<em>At War</em>, AF FFF19; <em>Rodin</em>, AF FFF18), reunites with acclaimed writer/director Stéphane Brizé (<em>At War</em>, AF FFF19) for the stunning <em>Another World</em>, delivering a powerhouse turn as a driven white-collar manager torn between duty to his job, his family and his principles.</p><p>Lindon plays Philippe Lemesle, an executive who oversees the regional factory of an industrial multi-national. He has dedicated his life to the company, balancing relations with his employees while placating his bosses and their American overlords. But it’s come at a high personal cost - he and partner Anne (Sandrine Kiberlain, <em>Sweetheart</em>, AF FFF20 and <em>In Safe Hands</em>, AF FFF19) are separating, and his relationship with troubled son Lucas (<em>In the Name of the Land</em>’s Anthony Bajon, AF FFF20) is also collapsing. So when the already-frayed Philippe is tasked by management with a downsizing operation, he faces a major crisis of conscience.</p><p>Harnessing the humanist spirit of Ken Loach, Brizé’s intimate and emotionally engaging film is a clear-eyed look at the pressures of modern society. Lindon is truly astounding, finding empathy and pathos as a man backed into a corner, but who decides to fight back. He - and the film - is a knockout.</p><p></p>
