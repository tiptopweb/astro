		</p><p class="astro-6DCGTPXF"></p><p>The follow up movie to Julien-Petit’s box-office hit <em>Invisibles</em> (AF FFF20) <em>The Kitchen Brigade</em>, explores the world of French gastronomy while also tackling issues of social justice and inclusion through the story of Cathy.</p><p>Cathy (Audrey Lamy, already starring in <em>Invisibles</em>) is an inflexible 40-year-old sous-chef, finally fulfilling her lifelong dream of opening her own high-end restaurant. Things do not go to plan. Facing serious financial difficulties, she reluctantly accepts a job in the cafeteria of a shelter for young migrants. Though she hates the new job at first, Cathy’s remarkable skill and passion for cuisine start to change the kids’ lives.  And it turns out they also have a lot to teach her.</p><p>True to his favourite genre, social comedy, Louis-Julien Petit explores learning, communication, success and self-esteem, mixing humour, humanism, realism and entertainment. With <em>The Kitchen Brigade</em>, the director pays tribute to young people with a tormented past and an uncertain future, holding onto hope of a better life, struggling relentlessly to integrate into French society; and of course, acknowledges  all those who devote so much energy to help them.</p><p>This feel-good movie with a strong touch of humanity also features François Cluzet (<em>Intouchables</em> and <em>We’ll End Up Together</em>, AF FFF20) and several newcomers, including Fatoumata Kaba.</p><p></p>
