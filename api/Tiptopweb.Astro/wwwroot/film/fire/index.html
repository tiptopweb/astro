		</p><p class="astro-6DCGTPXF"></p><p>Astonishingly, in all their years on screen, cinema icons Juliette Binoche (<em>How to Be a Good Wife</em>, AF FFF20) and Vincent Lindon (<em>At War</em>, AF FFF19) have never acted together. This anomaly is finally corrected with <em>Fire</em>, the explosive new romantic drama from celebrated auteur Claire Denis (<em>Let the Sunshine In</em>, AF FFF18), a blazing story about a passionate, complicated woman caught between two very different men.</p><p>Public radio presenter Sara (Binoche) and Jean (Lindon) are in love, and have been living together for a decade. When they first met, Sara was in a relationship with François (Grégoire Colin) while Jean, a pro rugby star, was married with a son. Their relationship has been relatively secure, even surviving a stint in prison by Jean for shady business dealings. One day, seemingly out of the blue, François returns to Paris and contacts Jean, suggesting he come work for him; he’s starting an agency for sports stars and wants Jean’s expertise in identifying talent. When Sara first sees Francois again - in the distance, across a carpark - she’s overcome with emotion. Soon, things rapidly spiral out of control…</p><p>Packed with erotic frisson and a series of dramatic, emotionally-charged encounters, the superbly acted <em>Fire </em>delivers two powerhouse actors working at the very top of their game. Don’t miss the fireworks.</p><p></p>
