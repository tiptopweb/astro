		</p><p class="astro-6DCGTPXF"></p><p><em>Rumba Therapy</em> is a feel-good comedy made by actor-turned-Director Franck Dubosc who plays Tony, a bus driver in his 50s, going through a midlife crisis. He lives alone, having abandoned his wife and baby decades earlier. Deciding to reconnect with his daughter (Louna Espinosa), who has become a dance teacher, Tony signs up for her classes, even though he hates dancing and has two left feet.</p><p>Following the success of <em>Rolling to You</em>, AF FFF19, another story of middle-aged reinvention, Dubosc harnesses that same endearing comedy to highlight the emotional vulnerability of an older man searching for greater meaning in life. Itâ€™s the kind of relatable melodrama that makes audiences root for the most unlikely of characters. </p><p>A touching film telling the story of a father desperate to reconnect with his daughter and who will go to any lengths and correct the mistakes of his past. <em>Rumba Therapy</em> is all about getting out of your comfort zone and sheds a tenderly funny light on father-daughter relationships in adulthood.</p><p></p>
