		</p><p class="astro-6DCGTPXF"></p><p>Following her César Award-winning performance in <em>Antoinette in the Cévennes</em> (AF FFF21), the marvellous Laure Calamy demonstrates the phenomenal range of her talents in writer/director Eric Gavel’s gripping and award-winning new drama <em>Full Time</em>, as a single woman pushed to her limits when the delicate balance between her home and work life is upended.</p><p>Mother of two Julie (Calamy) is making ends meet, getting by as the head chambermaid of a five-star hotel in Paris, with only sporadic alimony payments from her ex-husband. Each meticulously-planned day starts before sunrise, preparing the kids for school and undertaking a long commute to work, where she unflappably completes her duties in time to return to them.</p><p>But when a national strike breaks out - paralysing the entire public transport system - Julie’s routine is thrown into chaos, increasingly pushing her into a frenetic race against time that threatens everything she’s worked so hard for.</p><p><em>Full Time</em> has all the qualities of a pulse-pounding thriller, while offering a superb commentary on the daily hustle that defines modern life. Calamy fully deserves the multiple prizes - including Best Actress at Venice 2021- awarded for her work here; she and the film’s gasp-inducing final scenes are unforgettable.</p><p></p>
